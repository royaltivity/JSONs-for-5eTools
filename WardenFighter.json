				"Throughout the world you can see and feel the bonds that hold society together: the mighty salmon returning to ancestral speaking grounds to usher the next generation, the fox tracking the rabbit into its burrow in pursuit of a meal, a marriage bringing two families together for generations to come, the trust between a hunter and their foxhound, even a soldier and a blade handed down from parent to child. A Warden builds on the strength of that bond, be it with beast or blade, and forges power from that trust.",
				"Be it the unlikely trust formed between a fledgling Hunter and the wolf they carefully released from a poachers trap, or a young adventurer placing their life in the reliability of a worn, nicked up blade entrusted to them by their ex-adventurer mother, this bond can be built to empower both beyond either may ever have dreamed of.",
				"These bonds need to be fired by danger of adventure and cooled by the serene wisdom of mother nature in order to become the strength that is the Warden. They understand that these bonds are nature itself, and in selling to strengthen their own, observe and protect them. This reverence not only pushed their body beyond its limits, it grants access to a limited form of magic thought exclusive to druids. Whether a Warden is drawn into the wilderness because of this, or earn this through their dedication, one will never tell.",

This often is exercised by worship of a deity, commonly Silvanus (N), Chauntea (NG), and others. Evil Wardens might worship Malar (CE), or Auril (NE), although this is typically rare. Worship, while common, is not where a Warden derives their power, however.

If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand. Melee Weapons bonded in this way can be used to make Melee Attacks in place of Ranged Attacks required by some spells. Limitations of spells still apply (i.e. {@spell lightning arrow} expires after 12 ranged attacks, hit or miss, would only allow 12 melee attacks, hit or miss). If a spell effect would include yourself in it's area of effect, you may choose to exclude yourself. Bonded Weapons are not consumed by spells effects, and act as your Spell Casting Focus used in place of material components.",

This information is not exact (a goblin lair; the bandit hideout), but you know the precise direction in which it lies (15 degrees West of North), and the precise distance away it is (25 feet away, 13 miles away). Additionally, your bonded weapon(s) are considered magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.",

As an action requiring concentration, you can force your senses into your weapon and see the world from it's perspective. You can see and hear as normal up to a range of 60 feet. If you have bonded multiple weapons, you must select one to be the point of origin for your senses. You can sustain this effect for up to one hour, during which your body is unattended in the position you left it. Your body is considered helpless during this time. You may end this effect and return to you early at will. You cannot use this ability again until you have finished a short or long rest. In addition, it is now a free action to summon a bonded weapon, although you may still only do so once per turn.",

If you and your companion are traveling together and make {@skill acrobatics}, {@skill athletics}, or {@skill stealth} skill checks, you make these checks at advantage. These rolls account for both you and your companion, if one fails, so does the other.  Also at 7th level, your companions natural magic enhances its attacks.

In addition, whenever you cast a spell, you may do so from your companion, using it's space or its body as the spell's point of origin, as if you were in its place.",
